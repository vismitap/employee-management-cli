A simple **Java console-based Employee Management System** built for practicing **core Java, collections, and unit testing with JUnit 5**.  
The project demonstrates **CRUD operations** on employees, menu-driven user interaction, and testable business logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Skills Demonstrated
- **Java 21** (compatible with Java 8+ features: Streams, Lambdas, etc.)
- **Collections Framework** (`List`, `ArrayList`, `Stream API`)
- **Java Time API** (`LocalDate`)
- **Exception & Edge Case Handling** (empty list checks, invalid removal)
- **JUnit 5** for unit testing:
  - `@BeforeEach` for test setup  
  - Assertions (`assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, `assertNotNull`, `assertThrows`)  
- **Clean Code Practices**
  - Separation of concerns (`Employee` model, `EmployeeManager` logic, `EmployeeTest` unit tests)
  - Static utility methods for menu options
